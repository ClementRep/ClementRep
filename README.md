👋 Hi, my name is Clement Maimane.

👀 I’m a web developer passionate about building efficient applications and learning new programming techniques. I specialize in backend development and love optimizing code for performance and scalability.

🚀 I’m part of Sharp Coders, where I collaborate on open-source and team projects.

🌱 Currently, I’m deepening my expertise in Node.js, JavaScript, and backend development, while also working on Spring Boot and Java to expand my tech stack. I also enjoy working with React and Tailwind CSS to create modern UIs.

💻 Projects I'm working on:

Library Management System – A JavaFX-based system using MySQL for database management.
Zoo Simulation in Java – An OOP-focused project using abstract classes, interfaces, and inheritance.
Car Rental UI (clementrep-rentmycarui) – A React and Tailwind CSS application for user and vehicle registration.
Donation Web App – A full-stack JavaScript project to facilitate donations.
💞️ I’m open to collaborating on Node.js, JavaScript, Java, and Spring Boot projects, especially those that involve building scalable web applications.
